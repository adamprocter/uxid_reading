# Welcome
Reading lists and conference talk recordings are great resources. The world of UX and information design is a wash with this and we cant read it all but it might be nice to have a collaborative space to pull them together and then individuals can feel free to pull into there own curriculum.

I suggest headings to group topics. Harvard referencing and link to purchase / view would be end goal but start messy and build up.

Invite friends.
